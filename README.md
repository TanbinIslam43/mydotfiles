## Installation

This rice uses dwm and other suckless programs, to get the full rice experience, install them too (included in the rice info part)

After that, git clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/tanbinislam43/dotfiles.git
```
Then put all the files in place

This rice also uses Doom Emacs, so it is recommended to install it first from [here](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)
